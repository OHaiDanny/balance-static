Scholar’s kit has a few select tools whose usage dictates how the rest of the opener operates: namely Dissipation and Chain Stratagem. Where to use these skills optimally is less determined by a Scholar’s own kit - being that the rotation is simply a DoT and Broil - and more so determined by where the rest of the raid is using their own raid buffs to line up with each other’s rotations. Stacking multiple raid buffs has a multiplicative effect.

Chain Stratagem is varied, it has several factors that impact its usage within a raid setting. Usually, it is dependent on composition, but may also need to be adjusted for fight timings, though these situations are fairly rare. 

Dissipation’s alignment in the opener is set up in such a way that we ideally do not suffer unnecessary extra R2 casts, and also so that we get to use more Energy Drains under raid buffs. The question is moreso of whether or not the user wants to use it in the given situation, being that the usage of Dissipation prevents us from using any of our fairy skills for upwards of 30 seconds. Some fights have big incoming damage in the opener that require the fairy resources within this timeframe. However once optimized, you will find this is usually limited to fourth tier fights, and sometimes ultimates, since smart pre-pull usage will better cover this damage. In general, it is almost always a good optimization goal within statics in every fight to begin using Dissipation, but be wary of it during progression and with pick-up-groups (PUGs).

The best SCH openers are as follows:

## 4th GCD Chain:

Deciding which is more optimal for your group will depend on what your party composition is. 

Prefer 4th GCD chain: NIN, SAM, RDM, DRK, PLD

Prefer 3rd GCD chain: DNC, MNK, DRG, MCH

No preference: BRD, SMN, BLM, GNB

## No Dissipation Opener

If you are not comfortable using Dissipation, there is an opener that does not use it. This is *absolutely suboptimal*, but can be useful for comfort if you are uncomfortable with your co-healer or an encounter, or are doing first time progression.

Now there are two more important things to talk about, one which does not affect our opener and one which does. 

The first is eloquently labeled as “Prepull Stuff”. There are three key actions to keep in mind for pre-pull preparations:

* Recitation
* Seraph
* Mind boosting Potion/Infusion/Tincture

Recitation allows us to use either a pre-pull crit Excog (since Recitation allows the use of the action without Aetherflow to spare it), or a pre-pull crit Adlo which we can then Deploy. Which one provides more gains is usually dependent on your group’s cooldown usage and the encounter, but just be wary that using Recitation pre-pull also means it will not be available for the first 75-80 seconds of a fight, depending on how snappy you are using it. Also keep in mind that using a Deploy pre-pull does NOT require a crit Adlo, and very frequently it is a better idea to simply Deploy pre-pull with some small crit fishing so that Recit is still up for a later damage intake within the first 80 seconds.

Seraph is a niche pre-pull action to consider since it requires some weird timing to still allow the user to Dissipate. It’s also combined with not allowing us to re-summon Seraph for the first bit of the fight. However, with that said, there are still conditions with a lot of party damage that happens early in a fight, but said fight then doesn’t have additional burst incoming damage for a while afterward that allows us to consider this. 

Lastly, potions. Use these at -4s pre-pull so that the animation lock is resolved accordingly and we can begin casting Broil pre-pull. The current best potion for Scholars to use are Grade 4 Tinctures of Mind.

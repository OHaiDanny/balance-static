## Bard Openers

For all openers;

* Use Pitch Perfect at three stacks as able, and Refulgent procs as you get them.
* Hold Barrage until the next GCD if you already have an Refulgent proc.
* The best potion is high-quality Grade 4 Tincture of Dexterity.
* Try to use your second oGCD in the normal-ping openers as late as you can without cutting into your next GCD.

### 2.44s to 2.47s GCD

## Opener FAQ

> *Why are Barrage and Sidewinder delayed?*

To make sure all party-wide buffs are up before they get used. If your group has everything up a bit sooner, go ahead and use the skills then.

> *Should I use Refulgent Arrow between Stormbite and Caustic Bite if I get a proc?*

No, getting both DoTs up is top priority.

> *Why are the openers different at different GCDs?*

The GCD makes a meaningful difference in how far the end of Wanderer's Minuet is going to move (within the oGCD window) from its original cast. As a result, whether we want WM to be the first or second oGCD varies. Also, at a faster GCD a 13-GCD Tincture becomes more feasible.

## Openers

Listed below are all current openers and the reasoning as to why each one should be selected. It is very important that you attempt to put as much damage into the raid buffs of your party as possible. Wildfire is not flexible at all, as it is on a strict two minute timer, and because of this, it should be placed properly in the opener based on your party composition. Wildfire snapshots raid buffs upon use of the ability -- not on detonation. Wildfire cannot Critical Hit or Direct Hit, thus gaining no benefit from Crit or Direct Hit boosting raid buffs.

### General Purpose Opener

(Prepull Reassemble + Tincture) → Drill (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Split Shot (Barrel Stabilize) → Slug Shot  → Air Anchor (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Clean Shot (Gauss Round + Hypercharge) → Heat Blast (Wildfire) → Heat Blast (Ricochet) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) → Heat Blast (Ricochet) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) → Drill (Ricochet + Gauss Round) → Split Shot (Ricochet) → Slug Shot → Clean Shot (End Pot Window)

Best option for general play. Slightly stricter (~0.25s) than the Wildfire/Hypercharge double weave alignment. Takes advantage of all buffs with the caveat it will land in a four stack Embolden.

### 5th GCD Wildfire

(Prepull Reassemble + Tincture) → Drill (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Split Shot (Barrel Stabilize) → Slug Shot  → Air Anchor (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Clean Shot (Wildfire + Hypercharge) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) → Heat Blast (Ricochet) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) → Heat Blast (Ricochet) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) → Drill (Ricochet) → Split Shot → Slug Shot → Clean Shot (End Pot Window)

Very tight, as it ends Wildfire on a Drill. Should only be used for optimization purposes with low ping. Catches all raid buffs with a very low chance of missing a late Divination from Astrologian and a late use of Brotherhood by Monk. Catches five stacks of Embolden.

### 4th GCD Wildfire

(Prepull Reassemble + Tincture) → Drill (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Split Shot (Barrel Stabilize) → Slug Shot (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Air Anchor (Wildfire + Hypercharge) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) →  Heat Blast (Ricochet) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) → Heat Blast (Ricochet) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) → Clean Shot (Ricochet + Gauss Round) → Drill (Ricochet) → Split Shot → Slug Shot → Clean Shot (End Pot Window)

Lenient for moderate ping players and catches most raid buffs except for Divination and Brotherhood. Catches five stacks of Embolden.

### 3rd GCD Wildfire

(Prepull Reassemble + Tincture) → Drill (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Split Shot (Barrel Stabilize) → Air Anchor (Wildfire + Hypercharge) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) →  Heat Blast (Ricochet) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) → Heat Blast (Ricochet) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) → Slug Shot (Ricochet + Gauss Round) → Clean Shot → Drill → Split Shot → Slug Shot → Clean Shot (End Pot Window)

Only used for groups where the only raid buffs are from Scholar and Dragoon. Has potential for downtime or kill time optimization, but overall is very niche.

### High Ping Variant

(Prepull Reassemble + Tincture) → Drill (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Split Shot (Barrel Stabilize) → Slug Shot (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Clean Shot (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Air Anchor (Wildfire + Hypercharge) → Heat Blast (Gauss Round) → Heat Blast (Ricochet) → Heat Blast → Heat Blast → Heat Blast → Split Shot (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Drill (Gauss Round + Ricochet) → Slug Shot → Clean Shot (End Pot Window)

Should only be used as a last resort if you cannot reliably do any of the other openers listed. Desyncs Drill from the buff window to ensure Wildfire doesn’t end on Drill. The forced delay of Drill at 20 seconds fixes the alignment between Drill and Air Anchor.

## Which opener should I use?

Openers should be decided upon with taking into consideration kill time, down time, and party composition. If using a later Wildfire window results in a lost cast of Wildfire, an earlier opener should be chosen. Since Wildfire can't critical or direct hit, the only buffs to keep in mind are flat damage buffs.

3rd GCD WF - Very niche use. Mainly for fights where downtime requires an early burst window.

4th GCD WF - Works with most buffs (Trick Attack (NIN), Dragon Sight (DRG), early Embolden (Five stack, RDM), Devotion (SMN), and most AST card draws). Inconsistent with Divination (AST). Does not work with late Embolden (RDM), late Brotherhood (MNK) or a late Divination (AST).

5th GCD WF - Ends on Drill, thus relying on very good ping or VPN usage. Will grab all buffs excluding a 1.2% chance of late Divination and a late cascade of late Brotherhood. Standing near MNK for cascade priority ensures buff will hit in time. Mainly used for optimization with a RDM.

**General Purpose/6th GCD WF** - Grabs all buffs regardless of group composition. **Suggested for Party Finder.**

High Ping - Last resort. Delays drill by a single GCD after WF, should only be used if all other openers are not an option.

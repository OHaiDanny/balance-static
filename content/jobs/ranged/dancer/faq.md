  - question: Who do I Dance Partner?
    answer: >-
      This list is made in a gear/skill vacuum. This is the recommended partner
      priority list.\

      Special Note: some fights may favor certain Dance Partners over others based on phases/mechanics or ability to hit multiple targets.


      *Updated: January 19, 2021 to account for balance changes in patch 5.4.*


      1. SAM

      2. NIN

      3. MNK / BLM (Crit build)*

      4. DRG / SMN

      5. RDM

      6. MCH

      7. BRD

      8. DNC


      \*Data on BLM SpS build as a Dance Partner is not available due to length in time to reach BiS with this build as of this update, but value as a Dance Partner is believed to drop significantly between the two builds due to under-utilization of Devilment.


      This priority list was made based on interactions between all jobs and DNC buffs and by using the new Partner Calculator (created by @Hint) which is a useful tool to help determine who in a given log would be the best Dance Partner:

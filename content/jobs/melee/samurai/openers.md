Your standard opener which, due to the earlier DoT application, is ahead in output for the majority of any given encounter.

### Midare First:

Should be reserved for encounters with a phase or kill time such that you are able to land an additional Midare/Tsubame where Higanbana first would not.

## Samurai Non-Standard Openers:

### Alternative Higanbana First:

Alt. Higanbana first presents a real loop in which your burst phase plays exactly like your opener. It utilizes non-Yuki Meikyo, thus delaying the start of your burst by one GCD compared to the standard Higanbana first opener and is useful for encounters with awkward timing on mechanics with standard openers.

### Alternative Midare First:

Alt. Midare first presents a real loop in which your burst phase plays exactly like your opener. It utilizes non-Yuki Meikyo, thus delaying the start of your burst by one CD compared to the standard Midare first opener and is useful for encounters with awkward timing on mechanics with standard openers. Should be reserved for encounters with a phase or kill time such that you are able to land an additional Midare/Tsubame where Alt. Higanbana first would not.

### NoShifu/Cursed:

Only useful if it grants you a Midare/Tsubame you wouldn't get with Midare first. Substantially worse than any other opener otherwise. If you reduce fillers by one in the first loop, you wait 0.5s on Tsubame. If you don't, you drift Tsubame by 1.5s. Pick your poison. This is called cursed for a reason. Standard filler for all following loops.\

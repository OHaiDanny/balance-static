## Ultimates Best-in-Slot Discussion

If you're planning to do one of the level 70 Ultimate encounters, you should just sync down current gear. If you wear anything with an Item Level higher than 418 for UCoB or 470 for UWU, you will maximize the two stats on the gear. Just aim primarily for pieces with Critical Hit Rate and Direct Hit Rate. Both fights are perfectly well-suited for a 2.50 GCD.

The BiS for TEA is below. This is up-to-date as of 5.55.\

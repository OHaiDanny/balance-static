  - question: Are there any Shukuchi macros?
    answer: Yes, the main ones use either <t> to go to your target at the time, or
      use <1>,<2>,<3>, etc to go to specific party members.
  - question: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
    answer: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our
      rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a
      higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority. If you
      want to know more about the math behind stats and stat tiering, go to the
      sub stats tier list linked [here](http://bit.ly/substats).
  - question: Does Kassatsu's % damage affect Hyosho and Goka?
    answer: Yes it does.
  - question: Do uncombo-ed skills give Ninki?
    answer: No, they don't.
  - question: " Does Hakke give Huton/Ninki without hitting a target?"
    answer: No, It doesn't
  - question: Is high ping a bad thing?
    answer: Yes, but ever since the mini rework of ninja in 5.1 it has become much
      less impactful, though it still is a bad thing at high end of ping because
      NIN are still one of if not the job with the highest casts per minute at
      optimal play.
  - question: How much ping is too high ping?
    answer: As much as you can tolerate, there is no set amount.
  - question: Is there an opener with no double weaves?
    answer: Not with everything in it, but you can move mug to the oGCD slot where
      potion is if you aren't going to use a potion.
  - question: Is it galaxy brain to macro Dream Within a Dream and Assassinate together?
    answer: No, macroing skills together is bad, especially since they will not
      always be used at the same time, and because with how macros work, this
      would delay your next GCD every time.
  - question: Should I use Kassatsu on Doton?
    answer: After lvl 76, replace a normal Ninjutsu with Doton and use Kassatsu for
      Goka if you need to aoe. Before lvl 76 use Kassatsu on Doton over Katon.
  - question: What do I do in multiple target scenarios?
    answer: |-
      Two targets use AE/AC combo to either equally lower them or focus on one.

      For three targets or more, Death Blossom + Hakke Mujinsatsu combo.
  - question: When do I Katon/Doton?
    answer: In a two or more targets situation, use Doton if the targets are going
      to live long enough and will stay inside the Doton. Use Katon/Goka as a
      filler.
  - question: Is there a dungeon/normal mode/24man/non-savage BiS?
    answer: No, it wouldn't be BiS.ï»¿
  - question: Should I save Bunshin for Trick, or use it on cooldown?
    answer: Use it on cooldown.

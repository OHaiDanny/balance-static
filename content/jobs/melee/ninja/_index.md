Ninja is a melee DPS focused on super high burst windows. The rotation is super flexible, with one of the strongest raid DPS buffs in the game. Mudras are the backbone of our burst, which with its charges, allows us to do insane damage inside of buffs. On top of that, ninja is the most mobile melee and can adapt easily to any situation that may present itself.

Monk is a fast-paced, burst-centric job that'll have you unloading your entire kit every 90 seconds to chunk down enemies. Positioning is key for the Monk, as with every GCD having an attached positional, you'll find yourself constantly dancing back and forth between the flank and rear of an enemy in order to reach your maximum DPS potential. Monk offers a lot to consider with its fast GCD constant positionals, and rapid fire Forbidden Chakra procs, and is a job that'll rarely leave you feeling bored.

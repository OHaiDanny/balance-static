  - question: Why can’t I fit five GCDs in Blood Weapon (or Delirium)?
    answer: The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon
      late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and
      keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be
      very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the
      last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon. It is possible to mitigate some
      latency by using a gaming VPN (for example, Mudfish or PingZapper).
  - question: I’m disengaging from the boss, should I use Unmend?
    answer: Generally no. Breaking a combo by using Unmend in the middle of it is a
      bigger loss than waiting to get back to the boss. You can safely Unmend if
      you are leaving the boss for long enough that your combo would drop anyway
      (15s or roughly six GCDs), or if you are between combos and disengaging
      for at least one full GCD.
  - question: Should I hold Blood Weapon for Delirium? Should I hold Delirium for
      Blood Weapon?
    answer: No. There is no inherent synergy between Blood Weapon and Delirium—Blood
      Weapon will always give 3000 MP and 50 Blood, regardless of if you use
      Delirium at the same time. Unless you know your kill-time and that holding
      one or the other will not lose a usage, do not hold either Blood Weapon or
      Delirium.

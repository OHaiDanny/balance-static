Gunbreaker is the newest tank to FFXIV, added in the Shadowbringers expansion. It features a high damage output with a burst phase that happenes every 60s, fitting cleanly into party buffs. GNB also features a higher casts-per-minute than other tanks, which, combined with its strong mitigation toolkit, make it feel like a party-focused DPS.

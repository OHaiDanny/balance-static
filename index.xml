But to get there, you first must begin on the road.
Unlocking White Mage is done upon reaching level 30 with the Conjurer class and completing the quest Seer Folly after completing the MSQ quest Sylph-management.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 03:52:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/basic-guide/</guid><description>Hi there, I’m pyre and this is my long overdue guide to White Mage in Shadowbringers, one month before Endwalker release… Luckily, based on current information from the Endwalker Media Tour, most of this information will carry into Endwalker, though I will update it shortly after release. This will be a fairly short and straightforward guide that addresses the basics of WHM mechanics and play, and will be expanded upon in Endwalker.</description></item><item><title>Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/ninja/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 03:49:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/ninja/skills-overview/</guid><description>Weaponskills (Commonly referred to as GCDs) Spinning Edge

Q: Are there any Shukuchi macros?
A: Yes, the main ones use either to go to your target at the time, or use &amp;lt;1&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;2&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;3&amp;gt;, etc to go to specific party members.
Q: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
A: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 03:09:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</guid><description>Why is there a Doton in my opener?

How does Raiden Thrust work?
Raiden Thrust is an upgraded True Thrust. It combos into both Disembowel and Vorpal Thrust and replaces True Thrust on your bar when it’s ready. You activate it by successfully landing the positional on the fifth hit of your combo (Fang and Claw or Wheeling Thrust following Wheeling Thrust or Fang and Claw, respectively).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/openers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:55:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/openers/</guid><description>Dragoon Opener and Rotation The primary use of the Opener is to prepare your cooldown alignment for the rest of the encounter. With our new job design, it’s possible that we’ll actually have fight-specific openers down the stretch, and they’ll all be added here!
These openers have not been too thoroughly tested as of yet, so please take them with a grain of salt, and if you discover anything that flies counter to what we have listed here, please don’t hesitate to ask!</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:55:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/skills-overview/</guid><description>Dragoon Skills Overview Global Cooldown Actions (Single Target) Icon Name Acronym Description True Thrust TT Basic combo initiator for both the Chaos Thrust and the Full Thrust combo with 290 potency.

You have strict, long combos to execute and timers within those combos that need to be maintained. Unlike other Jobs - especially other melee - which rely upon a priority system for their basic GCD rotation, Dragoon instead has static buttons to press in a specific order with very little variance. Shadowbringers brings with it a new reliance on hitting proper positionals to trigger new skills.</description></item><item><title>DRG Leveling Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:47:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</guid><description>The basic single target rotation changes as you progress through the levels.
The general idea is to keep the Disembowel buff up and using the Full Thrust combo as a filler.
The Area of Effect (AoE) rotation, Doom Spike &amp;gt; Sonic Thrust &amp;gt; Coerthan Torment, becomes worth it at three targets. You still want to keep Disembowel up when using this rotation.
Off-Global Cooldown actions such as Jump or Geirskogul, as well as buffs like Lance Charge, should be used on cooldown on all levels.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/monk/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 03:55:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/monk/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Best in Slot</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/monk/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 03:54:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/monk/best-in-slot/</guid><description>What do I meld on gear generally?

What&amp;rsquo;s with the double Dragon Kick in the openers?
With Standard, you DK after Perfect Balance for DK&amp;rsquo;s higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally.

The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent.

Circle of Scorn is used before Fight or Flight in most openers and kept on cooldown in most phases for two reasons:
Its short cooldown (25 seconds) is equal to the duration of Fight or Flight, meaning one CoS usage should always occur during FoF regardless of their respective timings, given full uptime. Its high DoT uptime (~60%) means that any delays are likely to cost ticks at the end of the phase, resulting in a potency loss overall.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:35:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Advanced Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:32:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/advanced-guide/</guid><description>This section assumes that you are comfortable with the entirety of the Paladin kit, as well as the basic rotation outlined in the Intro &amp;amp; Rotation Guide.

Introduction to Paladin Optimization Because Paladin&amp;rsquo;s self-buffs (Fight or Flight and Requiescat) are very powerful compared to raid buffs (e.g. Trick Attack, Divination), much of Paladin optimization focuses around maximizing usages of personal buff windows within a given phase or killtime, sometimes at the cost of raid buff contribution.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:29:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</guid><description>Paladin Opener and Rotation Tanks currently use Grade 4 Tinctures of Strength (Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing)
Quick Opener/Rotation Graphic: Alternative In-Depth Graphic: 60 Second Rotation Paladin&amp;rsquo;s natural rotation is approximately 63 seconds long, which means Fight or Flight and Requiescat (both with 60-second cooldowns) are delayed by 1 GCD per minute. In some situations this can cost FoF GCDs or even a Confiteor usage before the end of a phase, and in long encounters with minimal downtime, physical oGCDs must eventually be delayed as well to stay lined up with FoF.</description></item><item><title>Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:27:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</guid><description>Paladin Skills Overview Buffs Iron Will

White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success. Below is a list of available options; keep in mind that it’s heavily subjective based on the encounter and your party.
Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes Natural Dia refresh (&amp;lt; ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog) Rapture that does useful healing, Misery Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below) Overheal Lilies Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable) Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:13:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers/</guid><description>Scholar’s kit has a few select tools whose usage dictates how the rest of the opener operates: namely Dissipation and Chain Stratagem.

So we&amp;rsquo;re here, finally with a proper writeup.
Making BiS was expected to be very difficult this tier with AST&amp;rsquo;s new affinity for SpS&amp;hellip;but instead it actually was quite easy. Avoid Piety like the plague and there you go, there&amp;rsquo;s your BiS pieces.
Higher Piety sets also have the nice consolation of having a wealth of Crit (rather than the traditional disgusting amounts of Det) so it won&amp;rsquo;t even feel that bad to swap to lower damage for the sake of Piety.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:00:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</guid><description>So, you&amp;rsquo;re (hopefully) comfortable with the fundamentals of Astrologian. Now, it’s time to talk details: quirky mechanics, important interactions, and optimization. We’ll start with the most straightforward topics and work up to the more complicated ones.
Sect Swapping/Stance Dancing In dungeons, you can swap to Nocturnal Sect after the last enemy in a pull dies, apply a shield to the tank in preparation for the next pull, and then swap back to Diurnal Sect.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:58:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</guid><description>What Sect Should I Use? Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong. The gap in overall efficiency between Diurnal and Nocturnal Sect is still quite significant, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off of using Nocturnal Sect when the situation calls for it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:51:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/openers/</guid><description>Opener The most up to date Astrologian opener(s) can always be found in the #ast_resources channel on The Balance Discord. Keep in mind that Astrologian openers are extremely flexible and depend almost entirely on the circumstances of the fight, the timings of the planned raid DPS bursts, and party composition. Any premade Astrologian opener is a generic framework, not a universally optimal opener.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of care to evaluate as many of the variables as we reasonably can and identify the core methodology of the most statistically successful opener with regard to when most DPS jobs burst the hardest and when other raid buffs should be coming out, assuming everyone is doing a proper opener.</description></item><item><title>Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:48:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</guid><description>PvE actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Malefic 1 Spell 400 1.5s 2.5s Deals unaspected damage with a potency of 150.

RS Alignment Choice After the opener (i.e. starting from the second RS), you can elect to either align RS with the beginning of WM or the end. The tradeoff is that WM tends to have back-loaded damage, but Army’s Muse makes it easier to deal nine GCDs under RS.

With the launch of Shadowbringers, Bard received changes that didn’t compromise its core identity nor feel of gameplay, but were still substantial enough to deserve major guide revisions.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/bard/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 02:14:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/bard/leveling-guide/</guid><description>A Guide For Bards That Aren’t Level 80 Yet While the main Balance guide is focused on level 80 gameplay, I thought it’d be nice to have something people can follow as they level.
Leveling content may not be tough enough to really need to optimize, but it’s still nice to not feel completely lost.
So, here are some general outlines for various level ranges, and tips for what skills are going to bring the biggest changes.</description></item><item><title>Best in Slot</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 02:11:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Best-in-Slot (BiS) / Itemization Best-in-slot New BiS (5.55) with iLvl 535 Relic Weapon

Purpose and Introduction The purpose of this guide is to be a comprehensive gameplay guide for how to play and optimize the DNC rotation. This guide goes over the fundamentals and job basics while also looking into advanced tips and tricks that experienced players may not know. Due to the randomness of procs, Feathers, and Esprit generation, DNC has a dynamic playstyle where no two pulls are ever the same.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 02:02:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Best in Slot</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:58:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/best-in-slot/</guid><description>BiS: &amp;ldquo;Speed 3655 SpS Tier (Relic)&amp;quot;:

I am Reina, a caster player, and I am standing on the shoulders of giants. This document aims to provide a comprehensive guide on non-standard rotation (also known as AI or Hypermeme rotation).

A: Purely a downtime tool, a better version of Transpose. Lets you build back up to Umbral Ice III + Three Umbral Hearts during downtime, so you can Thunder III -&amp;gt; Fire III when you can hit something again. If you end a fight in Astral Fire, Transpose into UI so you can use Umbral Soul. Do not use Umbral Soul during uptime.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:51:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</guid><description>Openers Openers should put abilities on cooldown, fit strong spells within buff windows, and minimize clipping. All openers assume there is a pull countdown and the boss is pulled at zero. If your group pulls earlier, adjust them as necessary. Use the highest tier Tincture / Infusion / Potion of Intelligence available.
With all openers being very close in estimated output over the course of the entire encounter, it is instead recommended to choose your opener based on your current spellspeed, with consideration towards potential fight-specific requirements.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:49:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</guid><description>PvE actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Blizzard 1 Spell 400 2.5s 2.5s Deals ice damage with a potency of 180.

Get abilities on cooldown as soon as possible. This keeps us from sitting on skills that are ready which could potentially cause lost usages. Get strong abilities under raid buffs.

RS Alignment Choice After the opener (i.e. starting from the second RS), you can elect to either align RS with the beginning of WM or the end. The tradeoff is that WM tends to have back-loaded damage, but Army’s Muse makes it easier to deal nine GCDs under RS.
Aligning RS with the beginning of WM is the easiest choice, but is slightly worse for damage.</description></item><item><title>An In Depth look at Dark Knight - Shadowbringers Edition</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/an-in-depth-look-at-dark-knight-shadowbringers-edition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/an-in-depth-look-at-dark-knight-shadowbringers-edition/</guid><description>An In Depth look at Dark Knight - Shadowbringers Edition An advanced guide to the class Last Update: 11/09/2019 - E3S, E4S added.

Keep in mind that Astrologian openers are extremely flexible and depend almost entirely on the circumstances of the fight, the timings of the planned raid DPS bursts, and party composition. Any premade Astrologian opener is a generic framework, not a universally optimal opener.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of care to evaluate as many of the variables as we reasonably can and identify the core methodology of the most statistically successful opener with regard to when most DPS jobs burst the hardest and when other raid buffs should be coming out, assuming everyone is doing a proper opener.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/astrologian-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/astrologian-guide/</guid><description>Intro to Astrologian Who Needs MP When You’re This Pretty?

You have strict, long combos to execute and timers within those combos that need to be maintained. Unlike other Jobs - especially other melee - which rely upon a priority system for their basic GCD rotation, Dragoon instead has static buttons to press in a specific order with very little variance.

To make sure all party-wide buffs are up before they get used. If your group has everything up a bit sooner, go ahead and use the skills then.

No, getting both DoTs up is top priority.

You can use Superbolide for Anti-Air to keep uptime without getting a damage down. If both tanks use their invuln, they can stack together for it.

We heard you needed some pointers on how to play WAR while levelling. The splits below are done based on what skills you unlock, and what you should take into account.
* Do your job quests every five levels.
* Upgrade your gear every 2-5 levels.
* Remember your role actions.

Quick Opener/Rotation Graphic: Alternative In-Depth Graphic: 60 Second Rotation Paladin&amp;rsquo;s natural rotation is approximately 63 seconds long, which means Fight or Flight and Requiescat (both with 60-second cooldowns) are delayed by 1 GCD per minute.

All openers assume there is a pull countdown and the boss is pulled at zero. If your group pulls earlier, adjust them as necessary. Use the highest tier Tincture / Infusion / Potion of Intelligence available.
With all openers being very close in estimated output over the course of the entire encounter, it is instead recommended to choose your opener based on your current spellspeed, with consideration towards potential fight-specific requirements.</description></item><item><title>Openers and Rotation</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/openers-and-rotation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/openers-and-rotation/</guid><description>In each opener, the first number refers to which GCD Embolden is used at, and the second refers to which GCD Manafication is used at.

Get abilities on cooldown as soon as possible. This keeps us from sitting on skills that are ready which could potentially cause lost usages. Get strong abilities under raid buffs.

This encounter is particularly killtime-dependent to set up an optimal final phase re-opener during the last few miniphases. Shown here is the fastest practical re-opener, for a kill around x:50-x:00. For later kills on the minute (9:00, 10:00, etc), simply use a standard rotation after 415 seconds.
For kills at different spots in the minute (8:30, 9:30, etc), adjustments can be made after four minutes to delay Fight or Flight and Requiescat for a different re-opener without losing a usage.</description></item><item><title>PLD Savages</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/savages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/savages/</guid><description>Current Savage Tier Optimization Umbra (E9S) Optimal rotation is kill-time dependent. With standard opener, both phasers in the first phase should align with Requiescat. Use Hallowed Ground for uptime on the post-tiles phaser.
Litany (E10S) Optimal rotation is kill-time dependent. To align the disengage for the second Throne of Shadow with Requiescat, we prefer 3-second prepull FoF opener with 60-second loop until Void Gate.
For downtime cup game dogs, hardcast Holy Spirit at the wall and drop an Atonement, provided you are not mid-combo.</description></item><item><title>RDM Fight Tips: Eden's Promise</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/edens-promise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/edens-promise/</guid><description>Table of Contents E9S E10S E11S E12S: Door Boss E12S: Oracle of Darkness E9S Movement for Brambles into Anti-Air/Wide-Angle In the first minute of the fight, it is preferred to hold your Swiftcast.

However, good oGCD planning and communicating your heals with your co-healer to avoid unnecessary GCD healing will have the highest impact on your MP efficiency. Correct usage of your MP generating/saving abilities (Lucid Dreaming, Aetherflow, Energy Drain, Recitation) will also help you maintain your MP throughout a fight.</description></item><item><title>Stats and Materia</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/stats-and-materia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/stats-and-materia/</guid><description>Stat Priority and Gearing Up When gearing up below maximum Item Level, you want to follow some general guidelines.

The Epic of Alexander is an Ultimate fight added in patch 5.1.

The general idea for Ultimates is to map out your rotation for each phase and be as optimal as possible in the usage of your Meikyo Shisui and Higanbana (and Tsubame for level 80). In stark comparison to Savage that also means you generally want to avoid the usage of Hagakure unless it&amp;rsquo;s required for you to start a phase with a specific Sen setup.</description></item><item><title>Ultimates</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/bard/ultimates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/bard/ultimates/</guid><description>TEA - The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate) As with any ultimate, mechanics are much more important than DPS.

Special thanks to Lynn Nuvestrahl, Sune Dakwhil, Chione Frost and Hinoka Shirasagi for helping me write this. It’d be somewhat elementary without them.
Introduction The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate) is the only ultimate released in FFXIV: Shadowbringers. The encounter is split into four phases: Living Liquid, Brute Justice/Cruise Chaser, Alexander Prime, and Perfect Alexander. The fight in its entirety is 18 minutes long.</description></item><item><title>Ultimates</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/ultimates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/ultimates/</guid><description>The Unending Coil of Bahamut (UCoB) Gearing For level 70 Ultimates, a full set of synced gear with Critical Hit + Determination and enough pieces with Critical Hit + Skill Speed to hit your desired GCD tier is more than sufficient. All pieces of item level 418 or higher will max out both substats in UCoB. Gear from the Swallow&amp;rsquo;s Compass dungeon and +2 Eureka armor matches the item level sync and may provide a small boost.</description></item><item><title>Ultimates</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/ultimates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/ultimates/</guid><description>The Epic of Alexander (TEA) Phase optimization Phase 1 - Living Liquid &amp;amp; Liquid Hand Phase GCD spreadsheet
Delayed opener is optimal for this phase, but fast pushes may require a standard opener to ensure buffs and MP are available for Phase 2. Paladin should pull Liquid Hand, but does not necessarily need to hold the Hand all phase.
Phase 2 - Brute Justice &amp;amp; Cruise Chaser Party-specific. Pre-pull FoF (6th Hawk Blaster) is optimal for this phase.</description></item><item><title>White Mage Best in Slot and Gearing</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot-and-gearing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot-and-gearing/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s my BIS?!

Purpose and Introduction The purpose of this guide is to be a comprehensive gameplay guide for how to play and optimize the DNC rotation. This guide goes over the fundamentals and job basics while also looking into advanced tips and tricks that experienced players may not know. Due to the randomness of procs, Feathers, and Esprit generation, DNC has a dynamic playstyle where no two pulls are ever the same.</description></item><item><title>Comprehensive Guide for DNC in Shadowbringers</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/comprehensive-guide-for-dnc-in-shadowbringers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/comprehensive-guide-for-dnc-in-shadowbringers/</guid><description>By: Ringabel Dim of Excalibur

This document will not be completely spoiler-free, as it will refer to many mechanics found within the fight.
Note that this is also not a full guide, but rather Dancer-specific tips for those looking to optimize performance on the newest EX trial. Please refer to one of the many other general guides for clarifications on mechanics.</description></item><item><title>Openers and Rotation</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/openers-and-rotation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/openers-and-rotation/</guid><description>OPENER INFOGRAPHIC Io&amp;rsquo;s Opener / Simple Rotation Infographic:</description></item><item><title>Savage</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/savage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/savage/</guid><description>Special note: DNC fight specific tips can be difficult to identify due to some things being party composition dependent and kill time dependent. In general, if you are learning a fight or going for a clear, it will most often be best to keep your cooldowns (Dances / Devilment / Flourish) off cooldown as much as possible and try not to delay. The tips found in this document are fight specific tips that help identify how to interact with certain mechanics, especially as they coincide with your cooldowns.</description></item><item><title>Stats and Materia</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/stats-and-materia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/stats-and-materia/</guid><description>Meld Priority Crit &amp;gt; DH &amp;gt; DET
What to do with iLvl 535 DNC Relic Itâ€™s BiS for current Savage content and for old iLvl synced content.
For current level 80 content: If you are missing other items for BiS, a good starting point is maxing CRIT and DH and putting the rest in DET. You can min/max your relic for your needs by plugging your gear into Etro and watching for wasted secondary stats.</description></item><item><title>Ultimate</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/ultimate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/ultimate/</guid><description>DNC Fight Specific Tips for The Epic of Alexander BiS - Relic Weapon (ilvl 535 custom stats) BiS - Relic Weapon (ilvl 515 custom stats) BiS - Ultimate Twashtar (TEA weapon) BiS - Edengrace Weapon By: Ringabel Dim of Excalibur
The Epic of Alexander is an Ultimate fight added in patch 5.1. For those unfamiliar with Ultimate fights, they are a significant step above Savage tier in difficulty in that they require a high amount of raid coordination along with high performance in all roles (tighter heal checks, tank coordination, and DPS requirements compared to Savage fights).</description></item></channel></rss>

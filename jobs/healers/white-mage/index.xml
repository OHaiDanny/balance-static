White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success. Below is a list of available options; keep in mind that it’s heavily subjective based on the encounter and your party.
Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes Natural Dia refresh (&amp;lt; ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog) Rapture that does useful healing, Misery Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below) Overheal Lilies Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable) Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Opener and Rotation</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/opener-and-rotation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/opener-and-rotation/</guid><description>What’s The Opener?

If you&amp;rsquo;re leveling up or working on prog, grab Piety to comfort and then:
Crit &amp;gt; Det | DH
The most important stat for any healer is piety until you have enough of it, and then any more than you need has no use.
I cannot tell you how much piety is right for you and your situation.</description></item></channel></rss>

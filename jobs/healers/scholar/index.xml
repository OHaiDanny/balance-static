Where to use these skills optimally is less determined by a Scholar’s own kit - being that the rotation is simply a DoT and Broil - and more so determined by where the rest of the raid is using their own raid buffs to line up with each other’s rotations.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 23:57:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/faq/</guid><description>Scholar FAQ How can I see my fairy&amp;rsquo;s nameplate in battle?
A. Character Configuration &amp;gt; Control Settings &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Target&amp;rdquo; tab &amp;gt; Under &amp;ldquo;Target Settings&amp;rdquo;, Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Disable targeting of pets and minions when in battle.&amp;rdquo;
B. Character Config &amp;gt; Display Name Settings &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Own&amp;rdquo; tab &amp;gt; Under &amp;ldquo;Pets&amp;rdquo; set &amp;ldquo;Display Name Settings&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Always&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;During Battle&amp;rdquo;
Both options must be set this way or your fairy&amp;rsquo;s nameplate will be hidden.</description></item><item><title>SCH Best in Slot</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 23:41:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/best-in-slot/</guid><description>SCH BiS and Gear Options 5.55 Savage Sets So, why the hell is SCH BiS 2.32 GCD this tier? The short answer is that our gear absolutely sucks for 2.41 this tier. We either have to take on a bunch of piety or use crafted gear, and neither one is efficient. 2.32 GCD lines up AF well, but sits on a sort of halfway point of DoT timings that requires us to alternate between 12 GCD and 13 GCD Bios, which can result in lost Bio ticks.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 23:38:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:33:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/skills-overview/</guid><description>DPS GCDs Broil III
This is the predominant spell that you will cast most often during any given encounter. This is your filler DPS spell that you cast when your DoT is already ticking and nothing else needs to be done.
Art Of War
This is the spell for AoE DPS. It has a base potency of 160. This is better than Broil III if there are two or more targets.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:33:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/basic-guide/</guid><description>Indomitable, A Thorough Guide to Scholar Author Tobio Okuma
This is a guide for the Scholar (SCH) Job in FFXIV. The goal of this guide is to give insight into how the job is operating in our current raid environment. I will go over all of the job’s skills and describe their usage, as well as break down how Scholar interacts with other healers. I will go through small optimizations, useful macros, and more.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 03:06:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/leveling-guide/</guid><description>As SCH itself is unlocked at level 30, this guide will start at level 18 (the level Sastasha syncs you to). This guide will assume that you know more or less what each action already does; I’ll briefly describe them when they come up, but won’t go into detail on them.
I recommend the Basic guide if you want a more detailed description. This guide will be broken up by major actions during the base game, and then by expansion.</description></item><item><title>Openers and Rotation</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers-and-rotation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers-and-rotation/</guid><description>Openers Remember that the exact ability usage in these openers is not strict.
If you need to use a heal in the opener, or hold an AF stack for later healing or to fill a later Ruin II weave/movement, do so. This is the ability usage you&amp;rsquo;d do on a dummy, but not every fight allows for it.

Piety to comfort (read below) Spell Speed (until 1015 for 2.43 GCD) Critical Hit Direct Hit = Determination Spell Speed Piety is the most important substat if it allows you to continue rolling your GCDs.
However, good oGCD planning and communicating your heals with your co-healer to avoid unnecessary GCD healing will have the highest impact on your MP efficiency. Correct usage of your MP generating/saving abilities (Lucid Dreaming, Aetherflow, Energy Drain, Recitation) will also help you maintain your MP throughout a fight.</description></item></channel></rss>

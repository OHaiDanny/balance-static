Highest level strength potions available. Always use HQ. Food will vary from tier to tier based on what foods are available, but usually it will be Crit/Det food or Crit/Skill Speed food.
Should I be using X opener if Main Tanking (called Primary Tank in some regions)??
Being Main or Off Tank (Primary or Secondary Tank) does not affect what opener you use.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 21:38:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/openers/</guid><description>Gunbreaker Openers and Rotations Openers Openers are designed to do a few very important things:
Get abilities on cooldown as soon as possible. This keeps us from sitting on skills that are ready which could potentially cause lost usages. Get strong abilities under raid buffs. This helps to maximize damage done. More damage is always better, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s free!

It features high damage output and high casts-per-minute. GNB also features a strong defensive kit that, when used properly, can bring a lot of mitigation to the table. Let’s get started with a brief overview of the skills and abilities available to GNB.

This is preferred by many groups.
You can use Superbolide for Anti-Air to keep uptime without getting a damage down. If both tanks use their invuln, they can stack together for it.

Note: this can be done without clipping at all, but this is difficult to do due to the snapshot timing of the orbs.</description></item><item><title>Leveling Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/gunbreaker-levelling-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/gunbreaker-levelling-guide/</guid><description>AoE or Single Target + Leveling The basics of GNB gameplay will change depending on what Character Level you are currently playing at.

Item Level
Higher item level means higher stats, and is usually an upgrade regardless of stat types. RARE EXCEPTIONS EXIST! Critical Hit
Meld to each item&amp;rsquo;s substat cap, unless it&amp;rsquo;s red or naturally capped. Exceptions of +59 instead of +60 exist Skill Speed

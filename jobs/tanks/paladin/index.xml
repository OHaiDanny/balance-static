Use the Tank Gear Manager (https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) to make your own gearing decisions based on personal loot availability. Prioritizing item level over substats is encouraged while learning new encounters.
Note: Early progression gear will often provide very different skill speed values from BiS.</description></item><item><title>Paladin FAQ</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/faq/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:10:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/faq/</guid><description>Why is Circle of Scorn used immediately in the opener?
Circle of Scorn is used before Fight or Flight in most openers and kept on cooldown in most phases for two reasons:
Its short cooldown (25 seconds) is equal to the duration of Fight or Flight, meaning one CoS usage should always occur during FoF regardless of their respective timings, given full uptime. Its high DoT uptime (~60%) means that any delays are likely to cost ticks at the end of the phase, resulting in a potency loss overall.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:35:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Advanced Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:32:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/advanced-guide/</guid><description>This section assumes that you are comfortable with the entirety of the Paladin kit, as well as the basic rotation outlined in the Intro &amp;amp; Rotation Guide.

Introduction to Paladin Optimization Because Paladin&amp;rsquo;s self-buffs (Fight or Flight and Requiescat) are very powerful compared to raid buffs (e.g. Trick Attack, Divination), much of Paladin optimization focuses around maximizing usages of personal buff windows within a given phase or killtime, sometimes at the cost of raid buff contribution.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:29:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</guid><description>Paladin Opener and Rotation Tanks currently use Grade 4 Tinctures of Strength (Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing)
Quick Opener/Rotation Graphic: Alternative In-Depth Graphic: 60 Second Rotation Paladin&amp;rsquo;s natural rotation is approximately 63 seconds long, which means Fight or Flight and Requiescat (both with 60-second cooldowns) are delayed by 1 GCD per minute. In some situations this can cost FoF GCDs or even a Confiteor usage before the end of a phase, and in long encounters with minimal downtime, physical oGCDs must eventually be delayed as well to stay lined up with FoF.</description></item><item><title>Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:27:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</guid><description>Buffs Iron WillToggle | 10s cooldown after toggling on. | No cooldown for toggling off.

This encounter is particularly killtime-dependent to set up an optimal final phase re-opener during the last few miniphases. Shown here is the fastest practical re-opener, for a kill around x:50-x:00. For later kills on the minute (9:00, 10:00, etc), simply use a standard rotation after 415 seconds.
For kills at different spots in the minute (8:30, 9:30, etc), adjustments can be made after four minutes to delay Fight or Flight and Requiescat for a different re-opener without losing a usage.</description></item><item><title>PLD Savages</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/savages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/savages/</guid><description>Current Savage Tier Optimization Umbra (E9S) Optimal rotation is kill-time dependent. With standard opener, both phasers in the first phase should align with Requiescat. Use Hallowed Ground for uptime on the post-tiles phaser.
Litany (E10S) Optimal rotation is kill-time dependent. To align the disengage for the second Throne of Shadow with Requiescat, we prefer 3-second prepull FoF opener with 60-second loop until Void Gate.
For downtime cup game dogs, hardcast Holy Spirit at the wall and drop an Atonement, provided you are not mid-combo.</description></item><item><title>Stats and Materia</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stats-and-materia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stats-and-materia/</guid><description>Paladin Stats and Materia Note: This priority is also applicable to customizable (&amp;ldquo;relic&amp;rdquo;) Augmented Law&amp;rsquo;s Order weapons (515) and Blade&amp;rsquo;s weapons (535) for current content, before best-in-slot is obtained, excluding direct hit rate (which cannot be added to these weapons).

Delayed opener is optimal for this phase, but fast pushes may require a standard opener to ensure buffs and MP are available for Phase 2. Paladin should pull Liquid Hand, but does not necessarily need to hold the Hand all phase.
Phase 2 - Brute Justice &amp;amp; Cruise Chaser Party-specific. Pre-pull FoF (6th Hawk Blaster) is optimal for this phase.</description></item></channel></rss>

The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon.</description></item><item><title>Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:44:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Dark Knight Best In Slot Day one prog set(s) will be listed immediately when a new tier is released, but pre-BiS sets will otherwise not be maintained on this page. Use the Tank Gear Manager (https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) to make your own gearing decisions based on what gear is available to you. Prioritizing item level over substats is generally recommended while learning new encounters.
Note: Early progression gear will often provide very different skill speed values from BiS.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:43:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:40:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/advanced-guide/</guid><description>An In Depth look at Dark Knight - Shadowbringers Edition An advanced guide to the class Last Update: 11/09/2019 - E3S, E4S added.

Hi! Emiin Vanih [Lamia] here. Myself and my companions have developed a compendium of information that will hopefully help you take your Dark Knight playstyle to a new level.

Its rotation features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in APM and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, putting many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows. It also has access to one of the most powerful single-target mitigation abilities available in The Blackest Night (TBN).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:23:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction First off, a word of warning: Do not use the gear given out by the first job quest. It is normal-quality, meaning it is significantly weaker than other gear of the same item level. The Steel Cuirass (ilvl30), for example, has about the same defense as a high-quality Iron Scale Mail (ilvl 23).

Because of this condition, it is possible to negate the damage downs by absorbing the entire hit with a shield, such as TBN.
The mechanics where this is most commonly useful are:

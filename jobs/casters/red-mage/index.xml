The core rotation of the job has not changed very much since its inception in Stormblood, and if you are already familiar with the fundamentals of the job you may wish to focus on the 5.x changes and additions to the job section of the guide.</description></item><item><title>Best in Slot and Gearing</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/best-in-slot-and-gearing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/best-in-slot-and-gearing/</guid><description>Gear Sets Food: Smoked Chicken HQ Potion: Grade 4 Tincture of Intelligence HQ Meld Priority: Crit &amp;gt; DH ≥ Det

This allows your Dualcast window to align better for later mechanics, such as for placing your bramble and tethers. What you need to use for the tether movement may vary based on the Brambles strategy your group does, but generally, a single Dualcast will likely be enough, adding Sprint if necessary.</description></item><item><title>RDM Fight Tips: The Epic of Alexander (TEA)</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/rdm-fight-tips-the-epic-of-alexander-tea/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/rdm-fight-tips-the-epic-of-alexander-tea/</guid><description>Table of Contents Credits General Fight Tips Phase 1: Living Liquid Phase 2: Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser Phase 3: Alexander Prime Phase 4: Perfect Alexander Clear PoVs Clear Logs General Fight Tips Managing Resources For all phases in TEA you should aim to finish capped with, or very close to 100 | 100 Black and White mana. One of RDM’s greatest strengths is the ability to pool resources for use in later parts of the fight, and ending the phase capped on mana allows you to execute a strong reopener in the next phase with two melee combos under raid buffs thanks to Manafication.</description></item><item><title>RDM Fight Tips: The Weapon's Refrain (UWU)</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/rdm-fight-tips-the-weapons-refrain-ultimate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/rdm-fight-tips-the-weapons-refrain-ultimate/</guid><description>Table of Contents Credits General Fight Tips Phase 1: Garuda Phase 2: Ifrit Phase 3: Titan Phase 4: Ultima Weapon Clear PoVs Clear Logs General Fight Tips Managing Resources Due to damage scaling in Shadowbringers, push timings in The Weapon’s Refrain can vary greatly, between groups and even between pulls in the same group.

XIVAnalysis is a tool aimed at helping you improve your performance, through both automatic suggestions and metrics. None of the metrics are fight specific, but it is very useful to see your general performance at a glance. When we look at your logs in #rdm_questions, we use XIVA.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t Engagement worse than Displacement?
Engagement is 50 less potency than Displacement, however, unlike Displacement which requires a full weave window, it can be double weaved and is a safer option in many situations.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/red-mage-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/red-mage-guide/</guid><description>Overview

A: Purely a downtime tool, a better version of Transpose. Lets you build back up to Umbral Ice III + Three Umbral Hearts during downtime, so you can Thunder III -&amp;gt; Fire III when you can hit something again. If you end a fight in Astral Fire, Transpose into UI so you can use Umbral Soul. Do not use Umbral Soul during uptime.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:51:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</guid><description>Openers Openers should put abilities on cooldown, fit strong spells within buff windows, and minimize clipping.

BLM has no bad substats.
Infinite resources and lack of damaging oGCDs makes Spell Speed a strong stat. More SpS can make the job feel smoother to play and make Fire Phases less strict. Aim for higher iLvl gear and get SpS to personal preference and comfort level.</description></item></channel></rss>

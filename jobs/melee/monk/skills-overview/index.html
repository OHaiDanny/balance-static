<td>Form Shift is a unique GCD, as it&rsquo;s not directly a part of our rotation, but it does enable our rotation. Form Shift grants the Formless Fist buff, which allows you to use any GCD and gain its additional form effects. Since this GCD does no damage, we only ever use it before pulling an enemy or during downtime.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>There are a couple of minor things to keep in mind here. First is that at every form you have two options for which GCD to use. Second, is that all positionals are worth 30 potency except for Bootshine, where you instead lose the guaranteed crit effect if you miss the positional. Therefore Bootshine is the most important positional to land, as it&rsquo;s potentially the biggest loss.</p>

<p>Chakra is Monk&rsquo;s job gauge, which stacks up to five times. At five stacks of Chakra, we can spend them to execute either The Forbidden Chakra, a strong single target oGCD, or Enlightenment, a weaker AoE oGCD.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways that we generate Chakra.</p>

<td>Finally we have Brotherhood. Brotherhood has multiple effects, but in this section we&rsquo;ll just talk about the effect pertaining to Chakra generation. Upon execution, party members within 15 yalms will gain the effect of Meditative Brotherhood for 15 seconds. While this buff is active on an ally, every time they execute a weaponskill or a spell there is a 20% chance that you will gain a stack of Chakra.</td>

<p>In terms of oGCDs, Monk is somewhat simple.</p>
<p>We have three buffs:</p>

<p>We never hold any of our oGCDs. You&rsquo;ll notice that every skills cooldown is a multiple of 90; this means that if we press them all exactly when they come back up, they will realign perfectly every time.</p>
